2013-06-23 13:59:44	geomyidae	I'm still relatively new to arch, but I find it surprising that nvidia-mainline isn't better maintained. It seems like it's easier for someone to use a newer kernel/nvidia combo in ubuntu than arch, which seems strange ;)

2013-06-23 14:00:19	MariachiAC	Hello in god afternoon. I think i might have a handle on this efi thing. I'm going to try to boot using efistub and gummiboot. The arch wikki says that it will find images in /boot So once the kernel is installed, do i need to copy images over since my esp will be mounted in /boot? furthermore, do I just create the gummiboot directory in /boot then and cp the config file there?

2013-06-23 23:14:59	sailerboy	rg_arch, i have banana bread in the oven downstairs
2013-06-23 23:15:06	sailerboy	and i'd like to be able to set a timer upstairs
2013-06-23 23:15:06	cinelli	zendeavor: but you do or use to code.. or do you consider bash on a differnet level?
2013-06-23 23:15:14	sailerboy	that annoyingly alerts me
2013-06-23 23:15:15	Boohbah	zendeavor: i did the admin thing and it requires too much human interaction
2013-06-23 23:15:17	VoidAtValhalla	graphitemaster: look at last 3 commands ... yes at first you need to ignore filesystem and bash
2013-06-23 23:15:17	Boohbah	humans fucking suck
2013-06-23 23:15:19	rg_arch	sailerboy: you could shutdown -h <banana bread>
2013-06-23 23:15:32	sailerboy	lol
2013-06-23 23:15:33	zendeavor	cinelli: bash isn't programming
2013-06-23 23:15:35	cinelli	zendeavor: and from reading your conversations you seem like you didn't suck at it
2013-06-23 23:15:41	sailerboy	seriously though
2013-06-23 23:15:52	zendeavor	cinelli: it's just a string of commands mashed together into a script
2013-06-23 23:16:07	sailerboy	ps4 is running BSD?
2013-06-23 23:16:09	cinelli	zendeavor: you make it seem like it can be done while sleeping
2013-06-23 23:16:09	Boohbah	procedural programming is still programming
2013-06-23 23:16:11	rg_arch	sailerboy: thats the only thing I could think of.. unless you are willing to do a big python code or something
2013-06-23 23:16:14	sailerboy	that'll shoot BSD's marketshare way up
2013-06-23 23:16:16	zendeavor	cinelli: it can
